While reading “An Industry Guide to Becoming a Software Engineer”, I questioned myself if i was even good enough to go into this industry. A lot of the requirements made me worried and nervous that I was not good enough. While I still want to go into this industry, I also want to challenge myself and know what I am capable of. I found this article to be really helpful and it inspired me to become better at this. I am not the best at programming and writing scripts but looking at all these examples gave me a good idea of what the real world of programming looks like.
On slide 22, it talks about what employer looks for in you. While comparing myself to all the qualities they are looking for, I would not be even close what they are looking for. Though I found this section really helpful, it also made me worried that I was not good enough to do all of this as a programmer or network engineer. This article also reminded me that there is always more than one job to do. Meaning that everyone is not going to do the same thing and that there is always something different to do either if you are a programmer or network engineer. 
Though this article was also really helpful, I feel that there are much more articles that are the same as this out there. While these articles can be really helpful and inspiring, A programmer will never know what it feels like until the day they are ready to go to an interview. Articles like these can only prepare and get a programmer ready for the day they get an interview. This article explains what it takes to be successful in this industry really well and it shows us what type of programming you will need to do to be successful.
While reading through this article, I also felt like it didn’t really help me at all. I got a gist of what it takes to be one but I also thought this was not really helpful. I want to be better at what I do. Although this article talks about what it takes to be one, it didn’t really give me advice on how to be better at programming. Though I know you have to learn most of this by yourself, I would like some advice too on how to be better.
Overall I really liked this article and I would want anyone who is trying to go into this industry to look at this so it can help them understand what it takes. Not a lot of professors would give them stuff that wouldn’t help but having reading this was really helpful and I gave me a better understanding. There are a lot of requirements and if I want to meet this requirements I need to take what all my professor gives me and use it as my own and make it better.
